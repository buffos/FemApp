# FEMApp

FEMApp is a 2D finite Element Solver, created during my graduation from Civil Engineering Department of Dimokririo University in 1999. 

It is coded in C++98 and its goal was to explore both linear and non linear F.E.M solvers. 

A lot of the comments are in Greek and the documentation is also in Greek.

Maybe someday I will revisit the project and rewrite it, with thread support and region decomposition.
